I am a quick learner that enjoys solving problems, my toolbox includes math, probability, and
programming skills. I am a high skilled data scientist, i usually try to solve almost any problem
using a data-driven approach. Thanks to my experience I am not only a programmer that knows
some machine learning algorithms, my approach to data science projects is based on the CRISP-DM
methodology. Since 2019 I have been working with cloud (GCP and AWS) technologies, I have skills
for big data technologies such as Spark, google bigquery, and apache-beam-dataflow. My main
advantage as a professional is my mathematical modeling prowess.
