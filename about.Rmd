I am a Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience who is also a problem solver that has faced a wide range of problems such as portfolio optimization, risk profiling (Quant finance) predicting productivity of salespersons, and talent churn (people analytics), in those problems I have worked from the very understanding of the problem to the deployment/implementation of the proposed solution.
I have a great toolbox that includes a deep understanding of statistics, math, and coding. My tech stack includes R, Python, and SQL.
